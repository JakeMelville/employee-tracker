# Employee Tracker 

## Description
This application was designed keep track of all employees and the role they hold within the company. The application is run using the integrated terminal. First, the user will be asked what they would like to do? They are able to view employees, view departments, view roles, add employees, add departments, add roles, or update an employee role. All the data is being saved to the employeeDB database. 

## Technology Used
This porject was designed using javascript. I downloaded the npm packages for MySql, Inquirer, and Console Table. This application is actuvated by typing 'node server.js' in the integrated terminal. 

## Future Innovation
Down the road I would like to add the capability to edit everything about the employee, not just the role id. Additionally I would like to be able to display all this information on a webpage, opposed to a database.
